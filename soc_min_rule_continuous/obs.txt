 
Code and data for the soc minority rule without the two especies defector. In here, we have the following: 

- identify all neighboring particles 
- check if one of them is defector 
- with some prob accept it
- if except vicsek-align with it



in the jupyter notebook, you can visualize the animation and plot the polar order parameter as a function of time (squared_displacement file, for historical reasons) 

to run, change the parameters in the params.dat fil, compile normally and run ./soc_min_rule params.dat

eta and sigma are there as reminscent of previous versions with volume exclusion (WCA modified lennard-jones potential)
