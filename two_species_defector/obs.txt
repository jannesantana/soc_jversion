 
Code and data for the soc minority rule with the two-species defectors, final version, all tested

in the jupyter notebook, you can visualize the animation and plot the polar order parameter as a function of time (squared_displacement file, for historical reasons) 

to run, change the parameters in the params.dat fil, compile normally and run ./soc_min_rule params.dat

eta and sigma are there as reminscent of previous versions with volume exclusion (WCA modified lennard-jones potential)
